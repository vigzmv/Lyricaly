###:musical_note: Get Lyrics on your Terminal  

#### Just because finding lyrics on a web browser is too mainstream, I made this to get them delivered to your Terminal.

#### Lyricaly gets Lyrics directly delivered to your Terminal for any Song. Uses beautifulsoup4 to scrap lyrics.  
#### Published at pypi: [Lyricaly](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lyricaly)

##### Lyricaly scraps the lyrics of the given song from [Musixmatch](http://musixmatch.com/)   
##### I am in no way associated with musixmatch and the correctness of lyrics corresponds with the data present in the database.
##### Lyricaly only scraps the present data from there and delivers it.

###### Note: English Language lyrics work fine. Spanish and french support is not good. Other Languages might work.
