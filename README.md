#### Lyricaly scraps the lyrics of the given song from www.musixmatch.com   
##### I am in no way associated with musixmatch and the correctness of lyrics corresponds with the data present in the database.
##### Lyricaly only scraps the present data from there and delivers it.

###### Note: English Language lyrics work fine. Spanish and french support is not good. Other Languages might work.
