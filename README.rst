Just because finding lyrics on a web browser is too mainstream, I made this to get them delivered to your Terminal.

Lyricaly scraps the lyrics of the given song from Musixmatch

I am in no way associated with musixmatch and the correctness of lyrics corresponds with the data present in the database.

Lyricaly only scraps the present data from there and delivers it.

Note: English Language lyrics work fine. Spanish and french support is not good. Other Languages might work.
